    <p>There are two variations of rowing: sweeping and sculling. When sweeping the rowers only hold one oar but in sculling they use two. Eight person crews also have a coxswain who steers and directs the crew.</p>

    <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7CSl9h9.gif" alt="Four" style="float:right;width:250px;">Rowing was initially used as a mode of transportation in ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt. The sport first began in England in the 17th/18th century with the Oxford-Cambridge boat race in 1828. The sport became very popular in England in the 19th century and was then exported to America.</p>
    <p>Rowing has been an event at all of the Olympic Games except Athens, 1896 due to bad conditions (stormy sea). The womenâ€™s event began in Montreal, 1976 where they competed in a smaller programme and the lightweight events were introduced in Atlanta, 1996. The USA dominated rowing up to the 1960s, then the Soviet Union until 1970s-80s, then taken over by the GDR (East Germany). Now the reunified German team dominates.</p>

    <p><!--<img src="" alt="" style="float:left;width:250px;">-->Before you can begin to understand the Physics within rowing you need to be familiar with a few concepts. The first concepts are <b>Newton's laws of motion</b>:</p>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>Newton's first law states that an object will remain at constant velocity/stationary until an external force acts upon it.</li>
	<li>Newton's second law states that the acceleration of an object depends on the mass pf the object and the force applied to it. This forms the equation F = ma. From this we can see that increasing the force increases the acceleration.</li>
	<li>Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that in every interaction there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the force acting on one object is of equal magnitude to the force acting on the other object.</li>
       </ul>
