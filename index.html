    <p>There are two variations of rowing: sweeping and sculling. When sweeping the rowers only hold one oar but in sculling they use two. Eight person crews also have a coxswain who steers and directs the crew.</p>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7CSl9h9.gif" alt="Four" style="float:right;width:300px;">Rowing was initially used as a mode of transportation in ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt. The sport first began in England in the 17th/18th century with the Oxford-Cambridge boat race in 1828. The sport became very popular in England in the 19th century and was then exported to America.</p>
    <p>Rowing has been an event at all of the Olympic Games except Athens, 1896 due to bad conditions (stormy sea). The womenâ€™s event began in Montreal, 1976 where they competed in a smaller programme and the lightweight events were introduced in Atlanta, 1996. The USA dominated rowing up to the 1960s, then the Soviet Union until 1970s-80s, then taken over by the GDR (East Germany). Now the reunified German team dominates.</p>

    <h1>Physics</h1>
    <p><!--<img src="" alt="" style="float:left;width:250px;">-->Before you can begin to understand the Physics within rowing you need to be familiar with a few concepts. The first concepts are <b>Newton's laws of motion</b>:</p>
       <dl style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<dd><ins>Newton's first law</ins> states that an object will remain at constant velocity/stationary until an external force acts upon it.</dd>
	<dd><ins>Newton's second law</ins> states that the acceleration of an object depends on the mass pf the object and the force applied to it. This forms the equation F = ma. From this we can see that increasing the force increases the acceleration.</dd>
	<dd><ins>Newton's third law</ins> states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that in every interaction there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the force acting on one object is of equal magnitude to the force acting on the other object.</dd>
       </dl>
    <p><img src="http://www.mechanical-aptitude-tests.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lever-class1.jpg" alt="Lever" style="float:left;width:200px;">The next is <b>classification of levers</b>. Levers contain three parts: the fulcrum, the load, and the effort. A lever works with a force applied at a point (the effort) moving a load at another point about a pivot (the fulcrum). For now you only need to know about <ins>class one</ins> levers: the fulcrum is in the middle of the load and the effort.</p>
    <p>By applying Newton's third law and class one levers you can see how rowers move the boat. The fulcrum here is the gate that holds the oar in place, the effort force is applied by the rower, and the load is the water being pushed.</p>
