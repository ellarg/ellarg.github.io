    <p>There are two variations of rowing: sweeping and sculling. When sweeping the rowers only hold one oar but in sculling they use two. Eight person crews also have a coxswain who steers and directs the crew.</p>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7CSl9h9.gif" alt="Four" style="float:right;width:300px;">Rowing was initially used as a mode of transportation in ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt. The sport first began in England in the 17th/18th century with the Oxford-Cambridge boat race in 1828. The sport became very popular in England in the 19th century and was then exported to America.</p>
    <p>Rowing has been an event at all of the Olympic Games except Athens, 1896 due to bad conditions (stormy sea). The womenâ€™s event began in Montreal, 1976 where they competed in a smaller programme and the lightweight events were introduced in Atlanta, 1996. The USA dominated rowing up to the 1960s, then the Soviet Union until 1970s-80s, then taken over by the GDR (East Germany). Now the reunified German team dominates.</p>

    <h1>Physics</h1>
    <p><!--<img src="" alt="" style="float:left;width:250px;">-->Before you can begin to understand the Physics within rowing you need to be familiar with a few concepts. The first concepts are <b>Newton's laws of motion</b>:</p>
       <dl style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<dd><ins>Newton's first law</ins> states that an object will remain at constant velocity/stationary until an external force acts upon it.</dd>
	<dd><ins>Newton's second law</ins> states that the acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the force applied to it. This forms the equation F = ma. From this we can see that increasing the force increases the acceleration.</dd>
	<dd><ins>Newton's third law</ins> states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that in every interaction there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the force acting on one object is of equal magnitude to the force acting on the other object.</dd>
       </dl>
    <p><img src="http://www.mechanical-aptitude-tests.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lever-class1.jpg" alt="Lever" style="float:left;width:200px;">The next is <b>classification of levers</b>. Levers contain three parts: the fulcrum, the load, and the effort. A lever works with a force applied at a point (the effort) moving a load at another point about a pivot (the fulcrum). For now you only need to know about <ins>class one</ins> levers: the fulcrum is in the middle of the load and the effort.</p>
    <p>By applying Newton's third law and class one levers you can see how rowers move the boat. The fulcrum here is the gate that holds the oar in place, the effort force is applied by the rower, and the load is the water being pushed. Newton's third law explains how when water is moved one way, the boat moves the other way. There is a force applied to the water by the oar and the same force of equal size but opposite direction is applied to the oar by the water and as the oar moves through the gate the boat moves away.</p>
    <p>Next we will look at <b>buoyancy</b>. Buoyancy is an upward force exerted by a fluid opposing the weight of a partially or fully submerged object. It describes how well an object floats. The rowing boat needs to support the weight of the rowers while remaining afloat. <ins>Archimede's principle</ins> states that the boyancy force = mass of the fluid displaced x gravity. This helps to explain why certain objects float. When an object is placed in a fluid and sinks it will displace its mass equivalent of the fluid but the density of the object is greater than the density of the fluid. This greater density results in a net donward force causing the object to sink. An object that is less dense than the fluid will have a net upward force allowing the object to float. This means for a boat to stay afloat it needs to have a low desnity allowing the mass to be spread out so more weight can be held.</p>
    <!--more concepts-->
    <p>Taking all of this into consideration we can see how rowers increase the speed at which they move and why this is effective. Using Newton's third law it is clear that the more water that can be pushed, the faster the boat will be propelled backwards. Looking at Newton's second law you can see that for the same force applied a lighter mass with have a higher acceleration meaning higher speeds will be reached. The rowing stroke needs to be as efficient as possible when racing against top crews. Let's say the average female four races 2000m in 6.5 minutes and the average athlete exerts 350 watts, using E = Pt we can find the energy each athlete produces during the race:</p>
	<dd>350W x 6.5 mins x 60 secs = 1.37 x 10<sup>5</sup> Joules.</dd>
    <p>This is why it is so important that the rowers take full strokes: place the oar in and take the oar out at the ends of the movement. Missing something as small as 10% of the stroke reduces the power output drastically and can greatly hinder the results of the race.</p>
